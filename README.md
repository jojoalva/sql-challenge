PostgreSQL challenge

Description:

A PostgreSQL challenge, using pgAdmin 4 software to query 6 tables within a database to find out data on people whom a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 

Instructions for use:

        1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed pgAdmin 4. If not, you can find this at:
        https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/. Please refer to the instructions on how to use pgAdmin 4 on the above website.

        2. Download the 6 csv files in the 'data' directory within this repository.

        3. Create a database called 'employees_db' within pgAdmin 4.

        4. Load the 'table_schemas' SQL source file within the 'employees_db' database you have just created. This file can be found in the 'EmployeeSQL' directory held within this repository.

        5. Run the code within the file using the query tool. This will create the tables you require to load your data into.

        6. Load each csv file into the tables contained with the schema for our 'employees_db' database.

        7. You are now ready to load the 'queries' SQL source file. This is also held in the 'EmployeeSQL' directory in this repository.

        8. Run the code within the file using a new query tool page.

The 'queries' file contains comments on the instructions given by the company to source the data they require.

You should now have outputs for each question, which you can export as you please into a file format that the software allows you to export as.
